# Sales and Orders Data Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the **Sales and Orders Data Analysis** project! This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of sales and orders data using SQL and Python. The project features well-structured SQL scripts and an interactive Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate data exploration and analysis.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Sources**:
  - `orders.csv`: A CSV file containing detailed order data.
  - `Sales_Analysis.sql`: A SQL script with queries for analyzing sales.
  - `Orders Data Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for additional data processing and visualization.
- **Key Operations**:
  - Extracting, cleaning, and transforming data for comprehensive analysis.
  - Calculating year-over-year sales growth and percentage change.
  - Formatting date columns for period-based analysis and aggregations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Utilized for writing complex queries and CTEs to organize data processing.
- **Python**: Used within Jupyter Notebook for advanced data handling and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Employed for CSV data operations and data wrangling.
- **MySQL**: Used for executing the provided SQL scripts and managing the database.

## Key Code Features
- **CTE (Common Table Expressions)**: Simplifies and organizes multi-step queries.
- **Year-over-Year Growth Calculation**:
  ```sql
  SELECT ROUND(((sales_2023 - sales_2022) / sales_2022) * 100, 2) AS growth_percentage
  FROM cte2;

## Date Formatting for Period Analysis
  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y%m') AS order_year_month
  FROM orders_table;

## How to Use
- SQL Script: Load Sales_Analysis.sql into your MySQL environment and execute the queries.
- Jupyter Notebook: Open Orders Data Analysis.ipynb to follow the steps for data analysis and visualization.
- CSV Data: Place orders.csv in the appropriate directory for data loading and analysis.

## Insights & Results
- Analysis includes visualized year-over-year trends in sales.
- Extracted key business metrics highlighting performance and growth.
- Organized and structured queries with CTEs and date formatting for clear reporting.
- Future Enhancements
- Integrate predictive modeling for forecasting future trends.
- Extend the dataset for deeper analysis.
- Optimize data processing for scalability with larger datasets.
